Multi-leg (Level 3) Options are now available in Trading API and dashboard in Paper ðŸŽ‰
With Level 3 options trading, you can trade multi-leg strategies like: straddles, strangles, iron butterflies, iron condors, and spreads to capitalize on specific market volatility, range-bound price movements, and directional trends.  
This may help traders:
1. Increase efficiency by combining multiple options contracts into one single trade.
2. Enhance risk management by ensuring all parts of their strategy are executed simultaneouslyâ€“ protecting traders from partial fills and market movement.
