Multi-leg (Level 3) options are officially LIVE in our Trading API and dashboard ðŸŽ‰
You can now trade advanced options trading strategies including: straddles, strangles, iron butterflies, iron condors, and various spreads (like credit, debit, and calendar).
These advanced strategies may help investors:
1. Capitalize on market volatility, range-bound price movements, and directional trends.
2. Increase efficiency by combining multiple options contracts into one single trade.
3. Improve risk management by ensuring all legs are executed simultaneouslyâ€“ shielding them from partial fills and unexpected market shifts.
And with multiple paper accounts, you can test various strategies at the same time before taking them live.
