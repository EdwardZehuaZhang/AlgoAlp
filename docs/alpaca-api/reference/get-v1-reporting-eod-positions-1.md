get https://broker-api.sandbox.alpaca.markets/v1/reporting/eod/positions
This API retrieves a comprehensive list of end-of-day positions for all accounts. End-of-day (EOD) positions are typically accessible after 4:00 am Eastern Time (ET) on the following day, providing a comprehensive view of the day's closing positions across all accounts.  
This API currently only supports retrieving EOD positions for the last trading date.
