The customer identification program (CIP) API allows you to submit the CIP results received from your KYC provider.
The minimum requirements to open an individual financial account are delimited and you must verify the true identity of the account holder at account opening:
Name  
Date of birth  
Address  
Identification number (for a U.S. citizen, a taxpayer identification number)
