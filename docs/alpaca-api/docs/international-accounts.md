## 
W-8 BEN
[](international-accounts.html#w-8-ben)
For certain individuals, a W-8 BEN form should be submitted at onboarding. If the individual is not a registered U.S. taxpayer (not subject to a W-9), the W-8 BEN form may need to be submitted. The IRS explains [here](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw8ben) which individuals this applies to and provides instructions on completing the form. Every three years, in addition to the calendar year it was signed, a new W-8 BEN form must be submitted.
The form can be submitted in JSON, JSONC, PNG, JPEG or PDF. If submitting it in JSON, please see the W-8 BEN completed with the corresponding field names for the API [here](https://github.com/alpacahq/bkdocs/files/7756721/W-8Ben_Example_Broker_Docs.pdf).
Note: The dates collected on the form are in a slightly different format than how they need to be submitted via Accounts API. It is requested by the user on the form in MM-DD-YYYY, but should be submitted as YYYY-MM-DD.
