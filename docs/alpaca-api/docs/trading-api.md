Paper Trading

# 
Understand Orders
Our Trading API supports different order types such as market, limit and stop orders plus more complex ones. For more click [here](/docs/orders-at-alpaca). 
# 
Fractional Trading
Fractional shares are fractions of a whole share, meaning that you don’t need to buy a whole share to own a portion of a company. You can now buy as little as $1 worth of shares for over 2,000 US equities. For more click [here](/docs/fractional-trading). 
We only allow market orders for fractional trading at the moment.
