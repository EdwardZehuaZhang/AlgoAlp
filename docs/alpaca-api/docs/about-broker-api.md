Broker API Use Cases
There are several different use cases for Broker API integration. Below are some common ones, but please do not hesitate to reach out to our sales team if you have a different case in mind. We want our platform to encourage a broad range of use cases.
* Broker dealer (fully-disclosed, omnibus)
* Registered Investment Advisor (RIA)
_We support most use cases internationally._
Depending on the case, the API methods you want to use could vary. For example, the omnibus broker-dealer case never uses API to open a customer account since the trading accounts are created upfront and you will submit orders to them, and manage your end customer accounting on your end. More details on each use case are described in the following sections.
