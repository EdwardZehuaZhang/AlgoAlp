Alpaca Brokerage Account (Live Trading)
[](account-plans.html#alpaca-brokerage-account-live-trading)
After creating an Alpaca Paper Only Account, you can enable live trading by becoming an Alpaca Brokerage Account holder. This requires you to go through an account on-boarding process with Alpaca Securities LLC, a FINRA member and SEC registered broker-dealer. We now support brokerage accounts for individuals and business entities from around the world.
With a brokerage account, you will be able to fully utilize Alpaca for your automated trading and investing needs. Using the Alpaca API, youâ€™ll be able to buy and sell stocks in your brokerage account, and youâ€™ll receive real-time consolidated market data. In addition, you will continue to be able to test your strategies and simulate your trades in our paper trading environment. And with the Alpaca web dashboard, itâ€™s easy to monitor both your paper trading and your real money brokerage account. All accounts are opened as margin accounts. Accounts with $2,000 or more equity will have access to margin trading and short selling.

The Account Object
[](account-plans.html#the-account-object)
The account API serves important information related to an account, including account status, funds available for trade, funds available for withdrawal, and various flags relevant to an accountâ€™s ability to trade.
An account maybe be blocked for just for trades (`trading_blocked` flag) or for both trades and transfers (`account_blocked` flag) if Alpaca identifies the account to be engaging in any suspicious activity. Also, in accordance with FINRAâ€™s pattern day trading rule, an account may be flagged for pattern day trading (`pattern_day_trader` flag), which would inhibit an account from placing any further day-trades.
Please note that cryptocurrencies are not eligible assets to be used as collateral for margin accounts and will require the asset be traded using cash only.
