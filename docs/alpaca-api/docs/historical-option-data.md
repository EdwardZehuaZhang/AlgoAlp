Data sources
[](historical-option-data.html#data-sources)
Similarly to stocks, Alpaca offers two different data sources for options:
Source| Description  
---|---  
**Indicative**|  Indicative Pricing Feed is a free derivative of the original OPRA feed: the quotes are not actual OPRA quotes, theyâ€™re just indicative derivatives. The trades are also derivatives and theyâ€™re delayed by 15 minutes.  
**OPRA (Options Price Reporting Authority)**|  OPRA is the consolidated BBO feed of OPRA. [OPRA Plan](https://www.opraplan.com/document-library) defines the BBO as the highest bid and lowest offer for a series of options available in one or more of the options markets maintained by the parties. OPRA feed is only available to subscribed users.
