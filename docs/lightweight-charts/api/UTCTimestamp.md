> **UTCTimestamp** : [`Nominal`](Nominal.md)<`number`, `"UTCTimestamp"`>

Represents a time as a UNIX timestamp.

If your chart displays an intraday interval you should use a UNIX Timestamp.

Note that JavaScript Date APIs like `Date.now` return a number of milliseconds but UTCTimestamp expects a number of seconds.

Note that to prevent errors, you should cast the numeric type of the time to `UTCTimestamp` type from the package (`value as UTCTimestamp`) in TypeScript code.

## Example[â€‹](UTCTimestamp.html#example "Direct link to Example")
    
    
    const timestamp = 1529899200 as UTCTimestamp; // Literal timestamp representing 2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z  
    const timestamp2 = (Date.now() / 1000) as UTCTimestamp;
